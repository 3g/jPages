#jPages.js

jPages is a client-side pagination plugin but it gives you a lot more features comparing to most of the other plugins for this purpose, such as auto page turn, key and scroll browse, showing items with delay, completely customizable navigation panel and also integration with Animate.css and Lazy Load.
Apart from all its features, the main diference for the other pagination plugins is that with jPages you can create as many navigation panels as you want and you can choose exactly where to place them.
The plugin is very unobtrusive and it won't apply any extra styles to the items you are paginating. It will only create and insert the links inside the element(s) you are applying the plugin to, in order to turn them into navigation panel(s).
